Contributors, including assigned collaborators, should follow the [GitHub standard workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (e.g., fork or create a branch, make changes, and issue a pull request). At Arogi, we use Pull Requests often for code discussion. Thus, be explicit if you would like to merge your pull request.
